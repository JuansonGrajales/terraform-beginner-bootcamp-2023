    <h2>Rules of the Game:</h2>
    <p>
        Dominoes is a classic tile-based game that is played with a set of rectangular tiles. The basic rules are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start by shuffling the tiles facedown and distributing a certain number to each player.</li>
        <li>The goal is to match the ends of the tiles with the same number of pips (dots).</li>
        <li>The player who runs out of tiles or has the fewest points left when no more moves are possible wins.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Tips, Tricks, and Strategies:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Try to anticipate your opponent's moves and plan your own moves accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>Block Your Opponent:</strong> Prevent your opponent from making plays by strategically placing tiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Balanced Hands:</strong> Aim to have a good balance of high and low-value tiles in your hand.</li>
        <li><strong>Watch for Doubles:</strong> Doubles are tiles with the same number of pips on both ends. These are valuable for starting new chains.</li>
        <li><strong>Count Tiles:</strong> Keep track of which tiles have been played to make informed decisions.</li>
    </ul>
